In its first season, the Disney Channel's Gravity Falls proved itself part of a new wave of emotionally resonant, surprisingly thoughtful, wickedly funny shows aimed at kids. The show is the story of young twins Dipper and Mabel Pines, who are sent for the summer to live with their great uncle, "Grunkle" Stan, a cranky old man who runs the Mystery Shack, a tourist attraction in the town of Gravity Falls.

But Gravity Falls is more than just local color and mysterious relatives. It's also the sort of town where every paranormal phenomenon you could think of is real, and where little else is as it seems.
